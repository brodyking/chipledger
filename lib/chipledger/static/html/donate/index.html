    <p>Hi! My name is <a href='https://github.com/brodyking/'><b>Brody King</b></a>. I am a high school student in the
        United States who is <i>trying</i> to get a career in software development.
        Over the past few years, I have been learning new skills and applying them on small-scale side projects. Every
        project I work on has a goal. Chipledger had the following:
    <ol>
        <li>Learn javascript routing and sqlite databases</li>
        <li>Solve the problem of missing money when I play poker with my friends.</li>
    </ol>
    Since then, I have solved both problems. I wrote this website in vanilla Javascript. No React or other libraries
    (besides bootstrap), just some php for the backend and lots of DOM manipulation. This project, and many others, are
    <a href='https://github.com/brodyking/chipledger'>open source</a> on my GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>Enough about me though. If you feel this service has given you even just <b>$1</b> worth of value, a donation is
        greatly appreciated. Here are the operational costs below that are currently being paid out of pocket.</p>
